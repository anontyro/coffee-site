# coffee-site
A simple flat file site that was done in some free time on a weekend to try and give my own spin on a companies upcoming coffee products
and do it in a style that I felt was more inkeeping with the products. This site was done largely to test some JQuery scroll effects and
more CSS. The site does not scale well on mobile as the framework used is Skeleton which is a nice light weight CSS framework but I had 
issues trying to make a collapsible nav bar.

This site was createdly as a CSS test and I am quite happy with the overall look of the site, even if the responsive side is still lacking
a live version can be view: [On My Site](http://ghc.alexwilkinson.co)
